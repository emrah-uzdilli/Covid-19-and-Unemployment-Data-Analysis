# Covid-19-and-Unemployment-Data-Analysis

The COVID-19 crisis is one such shock, In 2020, urgent care centers saw visits increase 58% with record-high patient volumes during the second half of the year. First-time visitors accounted for nearly half of the 28 million patients who used urgent care. That spike in activity was driven by high demand for COVID-19 testing. By early 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had tracked more than 75 million cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., and some models suggest the total number of infections is much higher. The scale of the pandemic has had a significant impact on the health insurance sector. Health insurers are responsible for covering certain forms of COVID-19 testing.The crisis necessitated shutdowns of restaurants, office buildings, gyms, sports and entertainment venues and other businesses. Unemployment in the U.S. rose sharply from 3.5% in January 2020 to 14.7% in April, and more than 20 million people lost their jobs in April alone.
